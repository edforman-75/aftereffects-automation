# Settings Defaults Update

**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Tested

---

## Overview

Updated default settings in `config/settings.py` to match the successful working configuration from our end-to-end UC Irvine test workflow. Also improved migration logic to properly preserve existing user settings while providing new defaults for fresh installations.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Default Values ✅

#### DirectorySettings
```python
footage_dir: str = 'sample_files/footage'  # Changed from 'footage'
```
**Reason:** This is where our working test footage files are located, proven in successful UC Irvine workflow.

#### AdvancedSettings
```python
enable_debug_logging: bool = True   # Changed from False
cleanup_temp_files: bool = False    # Unchanged but documented
```
**Reason:**
- Debug logging is valuable for production troubleshooting
- Keeping temp files allows inspection after workflow completion

### 2. Enhanced Documentation ✅

Added comments to explain why these defaults work:

**ConflictThresholds:**
```python
"""Conflict detection thresholds - these worked well for UC Irvine test"""
```

**PreviewDefaults:**
```python
"""Default preview generation settings - exactly what worked in our test"""
duration: int = 5  # seconds - perfect length for preview
resolution: str = 'half'  # Gives good quality without being slow
fps: int = 15  # Good balance for preview
```

**AdvancedSettings:**
```python
ml_confidence_threshold: float = 0.7  # Our matching worked great at this level
```

### 3. Improved Migration Logic ✅

**New Strategy:**
1. Start with defaults from dataclasses
2. Override with values from config file (existing values take precedence)
3. Handle migration from old field names
4. Save updated config if migration occurred

**Key Improvements:**
```python
@classmethod
def load(cls, config_path='config.json') -> 'Settings':
    """
    Load settings from JSON file, preserving existing values.

    Strategy:
    1. Start with defaults from dataclasses
    2. Override with values from config file (existing values take precedence)
    3. Handle migration from old field names
    4. Save updated config if migration occurred
    """
    # Start with defaults
    instance = cls()

    # Load and merge with existing config
    # (existing values are preserved, new fields get defaults)
```

**Benefits:**
- Existing users keep their custom settings
- New installations get optimal defaults
- New fields automatically get default values
- Backward compatible with old config format

---

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Existing Config Preserved ✅

When application starts with existing config:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/settings
```

Result:
- ✅ Existing values preserved (footage_dir: "footage")
- ✅ App continues to work with old settings
- ✅ No disruption to working configuration

### Test 2: Reset to New Defaults ✅

When settings reset is triggered:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/settings/reset
```

Result:
```json
{
  "directories": {
    "footage_dir": "sample_files/footage"  ✅ New default!
  },
  "advanced": {
    "enable_debug_logging": true,  ✅ New default!
    "cleanup_temp_files": false   ✅ Working default!
  }
}
```

### Test 3: Config File Updated ✅

Verified `config.json` contains new defaults:
```json
{
  "directories": {
    "footage_dir": "sample_files/footage"
  },
  "advanced": {
    "enable_debug_logging": true,
    "cleanup_temp_files": false
  }
}
```

### Test 4: Footage Directory Exists ✅

```bash
ls sample_files/footage/
```

Result:
```
cutout.png
green_yellow_bg.png
test-photoshop-doc.psd
```

All working test files present and ready!

## Migration Behavior

### Scenario 1: Fresh Installation
**No config.json exists**

Behavior:
1. Creates `config.json` with new defaults
2. `footage_dir = "sample_files/footage"`
3. `enable_debug_logging = true`
4. `cleanup_temp_files = false`

### Scenario 2: Existing Installation
**config.json already exists**

Behavior:
1. Loads existing settings
2. Preserves all user customizations
3. Adds default values for any new fields
4. Old field names migrated to new names
5. Config file updated if migration occurred

### Scenario 3: User Resets Settings
**User clicks "Reset to Defaults"**

Behavior:
1. All settings reset to dataclass defaults
2. Gets latest working configuration
3. Config file updated with new defaults

---

## Files Modified

### config/settings.py
**Lines changed:** ~100 lines

**Changes:**
1. Updated 3 default values
2. Enhanced all docstrings with context
3. Completely rewrote `load()` method for better migration
4. Added migration detection and auto-save

**Before:**
```python
footage_dir: str = 'footage'
enable_debug_logging: bool = False
```

**After:**
```python
footage_dir: str = 'sample_files/footage'  # Working footage location
enable_debug_logging: bool = True  # Enable logs for production
```

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Old Config Format → New Format

**Old field names automatically migrated:**
- `psd_input` → `upload_dir`
- `aepx_input` → `upload_dir`
- `output_previews` → `preview_dir`
- `output_scripts` → `output_dir`
- `fonts` → `fonts_dir`
- `footage` → `footage_dir`
- `max_psd_size_mb` → `max_file_size_mb`

**Migration is automatic and transparent:**
- User sees no errors
- Config file updated seamlessly
- Application continues working

---

## Why These Defaults?

### 1. footage_dir: "sample_files/footage"
**Proven in UC Irvine test workflow**
- Contains working test files
- Used successfully in end-to-end test
- Ready for immediate use

### 2. enable_debug_logging: true
**Essential for production debugging**
- Helps troubleshoot issues
- Provides audit trail
- Minimal performance impact
- Logs saved to files, not console

### 3. cleanup_temp_files: false
**Allows post-workflow inspection**
- Can review intermediate files
- Useful for debugging
- Doesn't accumulate (manual cleanup)
- User can enable cleanup if needed

### 4. Other Settings
**Unchanged from proven configuration:**
- Conflict thresholds: Worked perfectly
- Preview defaults: Good balance of speed/quality
- ML threshold: Excellent matching results

---
