## Critical Fixes Completed This Session

### 1. Database Connection Pattern (3 fixes)
- ✅ Fixed approve_stage2 endpoint (web_app.py)
- ✅ Fixed validation service validate_job() 
- ✅ Fixed validation service save_validation_results()

**Problem:** Using SQLite cursor methods on SQLAlchemy Session
**Solution:** Migrated to SQLAlchemy ORM throughout

### 2. PSD Version 8 Support
- ✅ Auto-conversion with ImageMagick
- ✅ Seamless fallback handling

### 3. Stage 3 Validation System
- ✅ Complete implementation
- ✅ Aspect ratio detection
- ✅ Resolution analysis
- ✅ Database integration
