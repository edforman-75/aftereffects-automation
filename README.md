# After Effects Automation Tool

**Stop spending hours copying layers from Photoshop to After Effects. Let this tool do it for you in seconds.**

---

## What This Tool Does (In Simple Terms)

**Before this tool:** You spent hours manually copying layers from Photoshop into After Effects templates, fixing positions, adding expressions, and adjusting for different screen sizes.

**With this tool:** Upload your Photoshop file and pick a template. The tool automatically:
- ✅ Matches your Photoshop layers to the After Effects template
- ✅ Fixes sizing problems (like when your design is vertical but the template is horizontal)
- ✅ Shows you previews so you can pick what looks best
- ✅ Adds smart expressions so text and images update automatically
- ✅ Gives you a ready-to-use After Effects file in seconds

**Real Example:**
You have 50 player graphics to make for a basketball game. Instead of spending 2 hours per graphic (100 hours total), this tool does it in 2 minutes per graphic (100 minutes total). **That's 98.5 hours saved!**

## Is This Tool Right For You?

### ✅ You should use this if:
- You make lots of similar graphics (sports, news, social media)
- You have Photoshop designs and After Effects templates
- You're tired of repetitive manual work
- You want to spend more time being creative, less time copying and pasting

### ❌ This might not be for you if:
- You only make one-off custom graphics
- Your designs are completely different every time
- You prefer doing everything manually

## Your First Project (Step-by-Step)

Let's make a simple test graphic to see how it works.

### 1. Create a New Project

![Main Dashboard](docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)
*The main screen you'll see when you open the tool*

**What to do:**
- Click the big blue **"New Project"** button
- Give it a name like "Test Project"
- Click **"Create"**

### 2. Upload Your Files

![Upload Screen](docs/screenshots/upload.png)
*Drag and drop your files here*

**What to do:**
- Click **"Upload PSD"** or drag your .psd file into the box
- Click **"Choose Template"** and select your After Effects template
- Wait for the green checkmarks (means they're ready)

**What the tool is doing:**
Reading your files to understand the layers and sizes.

### 3. Add a Graphic

**What to do:**
- Give your graphic a name (like "Player 01 - John Smith")
- Click **"Add Graphic"**
- Click **"Process"**

**What the tool is doing:**
- Matching your Photoshop layers to the template layers
- Checking if sizes match
- Preparing everything

### 4. Review Size Adjustment (If Needed)

![Aspect Ratio Preview](docs/screenshots/aspect-ratio-modal.png)
*Choose how you want your design to fit the template*

**If your Photoshop file is a different size than the template, you'll see this:**

- **Left (Fit):** Your design shrunk to fit inside (might have black bars)
- **Middle (Fill):** Your design sized to fill everything (might crop edges)
- **Right (Original):** Your design as-is (might look stretched)

**What to do:**
- Look at all three previews
- Click the one that looks best
- Click **"Proceed with [your choice]"**

**Don't stress!** You can always adjust this later in After Effects.

### 5. Wait for Processing

![Processing](docs/screenshots/processing.png)
*Progress bar while the tool works*

**What's happening:**
- Matching layers by name
- Creating expressions
- Packaging everything up

**This takes 10-30 seconds per graphic.**

### 6. Download Your Result

![Download Ready](docs/screenshots/download-ready.png)
*Green download button means you're ready!*

**What to do:**
- Click the green **"Download"** button
- Save the ZIP file
- Unzip it - you'll get:
  - **Your_Graphic.aepx** - Open this in After Effects
  - **Hard_Card.json** - Data file (if you're using expressions)
  - **Preview images** - To see what was done

### 7. Open in After Effects

**What to do:**
1. Open After Effects
2. **File → Open Project**
3. Select the `.aepx` file you just downloaded
4. Your graphic is ready to render! 🎉

**To update text, images, etc:**
- Find the "Hard_Card" composition in your Project panel
- Open it and change values
- Everything updates automatically!

## Common Questions

### "What if the layer names don't match perfectly?"

**The tool is smart:**
- If your PSD has "Player Name" and template has "Player_Name", it figures it out
- It handles spaces, underscores, and capitalization differences
- You'll see a confidence score:
  - 🟢 Green = excellent match (95%+)
  - 🟡 Yellow = probable match (70-95%)
  - 🔴 Red = uncertain (under 70%)

**If it can't figure it out:**
- It skips that layer and tells you
- You can manually fix it in After Effects in 5 seconds

### "What if I have 50 graphics to make?"

**That's where this tool shines!**

1. Create your project
2. Click **"Add Multiple Graphics"**
3. Drag all 50 PSD files at once
4. Click **"Process All"**
5. Go get coffee ☕ (takes about 5-10 minutes for 50 graphics)
6. Come back to 50 ready-to-use After Effects files!

### "Can I use my own custom templates?"

**Yes!** Any After Effects template (.aepx file) works. The tool reads the layer names and does its best to match them to your Photoshop layers.

**Tip:** The better you name your layers, the better the matches!

### "What if something goes wrong?"

**The tool is forgiving:**
- If processing fails, click the **"Retry"** button
- It tells you what went wrong in plain English
- It saves your progress - you don't start over
- You can skip graphics that have problems and come back to them later

### "Do I need internet?"

**No!** Everything runs on your computer. Your files never leave your machine. Total privacy!

### "Is this safe? Will it mess up my files?"

**100% safe:**
- The tool NEVER modifies your original PSD or AEPX files
- It creates NEW After Effects files
- Your originals stay untouched
- You can delete the results and try again anytime

## Tips for Best Results

### ✏️ Name Your Photoshop Layers Clearly

**Good layer names:**
- `Player Name`
- `Team Logo`
- `Score Home`
- `Background Image`

**Bad layer names:**
- `Layer 1`
- `Text`
- `Image Copy 3`

**Why:** The tool matches by name. Clear names = better matches = less manual fixing.

### 📁 Keep Your Files Organized

**Before you start:**
```
My Project/
  ├── Photoshop Files/
  │     ├── player_01.psd
  │     ├── player_02.psd
  │     └── player_03.psd
  └── Templates/
        └── player_template.aepx
```

**After processing:**
```
My Project/
  └── Finished Graphics/
        ├── player_01.aepx
        ├── player_02.aepx
        └── player_03.aepx
```

### 🎯 Start Small

**For your first time:**
1. Try ONE simple graphic
2. See how it works
3. Open the result in After Effects
4. Look at what it did
5. Then batch process more!

**Don't jump into 100 graphics on day one.** Learn the tool first.

## Getting Help

### If you get stuck:

1. **Check this guide** - Read through the steps again carefully
2. **Look at error messages** - They tell you exactly what to fix
3. **Try the sample files** - We include test files to practice with
4. **Ask for help** - See the Support section below

### Common Quick Fixes:

**"Tool won't start"**
- Make sure Python is installed: type `python3 --version` in Terminal
- You should see `Python 3.10` or higher

**"Can't upload files"**
- Make sure files aren't open in Photoshop or After Effects
- Check that files are actually .psd and .aepx (not .psdx or .aep)
- Ensure you have read/write permissions for the project directory

**"Weird sizing"**
- Your PSD and template are different dimensions
- Just choose "Fit" or "Fill" when the preview appears

**"Missing layers"**
- Layer names in PSD don't match template names
- Check your layer names - they should be similar

## What This Tool Doesn't Do

**Be realistic about expectations:**

❌ Won't create designs for you (you still need Photoshop skills)
❌ Won't make bad templates good (garbage in, garbage out)
❌ Won't fix poorly organized Photoshop files
❌ Won't replace After Effects (you still need it to render)
❌ Won't read your mind about creative decisions

**What it DOES do:**

✅ Saves you hours of repetitive copying and pasting
✅ Reduces human error
✅ Makes batch work actually possible
✅ Handles the boring technical stuff
✅ Lets you focus on creative decisions, not tedious work
