# After Effects Automation Tool

**Stop spending hours copying layers from Photoshop to After Effects. Let this tool do it for you in seconds.**

---

## What This Tool Does (In Simple Terms)

**Before this tool:** You spent hours manually copying layers from Photoshop into After Effects templates, fixing positions, adding expressions, and adjusting for different screen sizes.

**With this tool:** Upload your Photoshop file and pick a template. The tool automatically:
- ‚úÖ Matches your Photoshop layers to the After Effects template
- ‚úÖ Fixes sizing problems (like when your design is vertical but the template is horizontal)
- ‚úÖ Shows you previews so you can pick what looks best
- ‚úÖ Adds smart expressions so text and images update automatically
- ‚úÖ Gives you a ready-to-use After Effects file in seconds

**Real Example:**
You have 50 player graphics to make for a basketball game. Instead of spending 2 hours per graphic (100 hours total), this tool does it in 2 minutes per graphic (100 minutes total). **That's 98.5 hours saved!**

---

## Is This Tool Right For You?

### ‚úÖ You should use this if:
- You make lots of similar graphics (sports, news, social media)
- You have Photoshop designs and After Effects templates
- You're tired of repetitive manual work
- You want to spend more time being creative, less time copying and pasting

### ‚ùå This might not be for you if:
- You only make one-off custom graphics
- Your designs are completely different every time
- You prefer doing everything manually

---

## What You'll Need

### On Your Computer:
- A Mac or Windows computer (Mac is easier to set up)
- After Effects installed (any version from 2020 or newer)
- About 30 minutes for first-time setup

### Your Files:
- Photoshop files (.psd) - Your designs
- After Effects templates (.aepx) - Your templates
- That's it!

## Your First Project (Step-by-Step)

Let's make a simple test graphic to see how it works.

### 1. Create a New Project

![Main Dashboard](docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)
*The main screen you'll see when you open the tool*

**What to do:**
- Click the big blue **"New Project"** button
- Give it a name like "Test Project"
- Click **"Create"**

### 2. Upload Your Files

![Upload Screen](docs/screenshots/upload.png)
*Drag and drop your files here*

**What to do:**
- Click **"Upload PSD"** or drag your .psd file into the box
- Click **"Choose Template"** and select your After Effects template
- Wait for the green checkmarks (means they're ready)

**What the tool is doing:**
Reading your files to understand the layers and sizes.

### 3. Add a Graphic

**What to do:**
- Give your graphic a name (like "Player 01 - John Smith")
- Click **"Add Graphic"**
- Click **"Process"**

**What the tool is doing:**
- Matching your Photoshop layers to the template layers
- Checking if sizes match
- Preparing everything

### 4. Review Size Adjustment (If Needed)

![Aspect Ratio Preview](docs/screenshots/aspect-ratio-modal.png)
*Choose how you want your design to fit the template*

**If your Photoshop file is a different size than the template, you'll see this:**

- **Left (Fit):** Your design shrunk to fit inside (might have black bars)
- **Middle (Fill):** Your design sized to fill everything (might crop edges)
- **Right (Original):** Your design as-is (might look stretched)

**What to do:**
- Look at all three previews
- Click the one that looks best
- Click **"Proceed with [your choice]"**

**Don't stress!** You can always adjust this later in After Effects.

### 5. Wait for Processing

![Processing](docs/screenshots/processing.png)
*Progress bar while the tool works*

**What's happening:**
- Matching layers by name
- Creating expressions
- Packaging everything up

**This takes 10-30 seconds per graphic.**

### 6. Download Your Result

![Download Ready](docs/screenshots/download-ready.png)
*Green download button means you're ready!*

**What to do:**
- Click the green **"Download"** button
- Save the ZIP file
- Unzip it - you'll get:
  - **Your_Graphic.aepx** - Open this in After Effects
  - **Hard_Card.json** - Data file (if you're using expressions)
  - **Preview images** - To see what was done

### 7. Open in After Effects

**What to do:**
1. Open After Effects
2. **File ‚Üí Open Project**
3. Select the `.aepx` file you just downloaded
4. Your graphic is ready to render! üéâ

**To update text, images, etc:**
- Find the "Hard_Card" composition in your Project panel
- Open it and change values
- Everything updates automatically!

## Common Questions

### "What if the layer names don't match perfectly?"

**The tool is smart:**
- If your PSD has "Player Name" and template has "Player_Name", it figures it out
- It handles spaces, underscores, and capitalization differences
- You'll see a confidence score:
  - üü¢ Green = excellent match (95%+)
  - üü° Yellow = probable match (70-95%)
  - üî¥ Red = uncertain (under 70%)

**If it can't figure it out:**
- It skips that layer and tells you
- You can manually fix it in After Effects in 5 seconds

### "What if I have 50 graphics to make?"

**That's where this tool shines!**

1. Create your project
2. Click **"Add Multiple Graphics"**
3. Drag all 50 PSD files at once
4. Click **"Process All"**
5. Go get coffee ‚òï (takes about 5-10 minutes for 50 graphics)
6. Come back to 50 ready-to-use After Effects files!

### "Can I use my own custom templates?"

**Yes!** Any After Effects template (.aepx file) works. The tool reads the layer names and does its best to match them to your Photoshop layers.

**Tip:** The better you name your layers, the better the matches!

### "What if something goes wrong?"

**The tool is forgiving:**
- If processing fails, click the **"Retry"** button
- It tells you what went wrong in plain English
- It saves your progress - you don't start over
- You can skip graphics that have problems and come back to them later

### "Do I need internet?"

**No!** Everything runs on your computer. Your files never leave your machine. Total privacy!

### "Is this safe? Will it mess up my files?"

**100% safe:**
- The tool NEVER modifies your original PSD or AEPX files
- It creates NEW After Effects files
- Your originals stay untouched
- You can delete the results and try again anytime

## Tips for Best Results

### ‚úèÔ∏è Name Your Photoshop Layers Clearly

**Good layer names:**
- `Player Name`
- `Team Logo`
- `Score Home`
- `Background Image`

**Bad layer names:**
- `Layer 1`
- `Text`
- `Image Copy 3`

**Why:** The tool matches by name. Clear names = better matches = less manual fixing.

### üìÅ Keep Your Files Organized

**Before you start:**
```
My Project/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Photoshop Files/
  ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ player_01.psd
  ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ player_02.psd
  ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ player_03.psd
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Templates/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ player_template.aepx
```

**After processing:**
```
My Project/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Finished Graphics/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ player_01.aepx
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ player_02.aepx
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ player_03.aepx
```

### üéØ Start Small

**For your first time:**
1. Try ONE simple graphic
2. See how it works
3. Open the result in After Effects
4. Look at what it did
5. Then batch process more!

**Don't jump into 100 graphics on day one.** Learn the tool first.

## Getting Help

### If you get stuck:

1. **Check this guide** - Read through the steps again carefully
2. **Look at error messages** - They tell you exactly what to fix

### Common Quick Fixes:

**"Tool won't start"**

- You should see something like `Python 3.8.10` or higher

**"Can't upload files"**
- Make sure files aren't open in Photoshop or After Effects
- Check that files are actually .psd and .aepx (not .psdx or .aep)

**"Weird sizing"**
- Your PSD and template are different dimensions
- Just choose "Fit" or "Fill" when the preview appears

**"Missing layers"**
- Layer names in PSD don't match template names
- Check your layer names - they should be similar

## What This Tool Doesn't Do

**Be realistic about expectations:**

‚ùå Won't create designs for you (you still need Photoshop skills)
‚ùå Won't make bad templates good (garbage in, garbage out)
‚ùå Won't fix poorly organized Photoshop files
‚ùå Won't replace After Effects (you still need it to render)
‚ùå Won't read your mind about creative decisions

**What it DOES do:**

‚úÖ Saves you hours of repetitive copying and pasting
‚úÖ Reduces human error
‚úÖ Makes batch work actually possible
‚úÖ Handles the boring technical stuff
‚úÖ Lets you focus on creative decisions, not tedious work
