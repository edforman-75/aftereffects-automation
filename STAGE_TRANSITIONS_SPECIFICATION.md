# Automated Stage Transitions with Pre-Processing - Specification

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: üìã **Specification Complete** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implementation Pending**
**Builds On**: Core batch processing backend (Stages 0-1 complete)

---

## üéØ Concept

When a human approves a stage, the system **immediately begins preparing everything needed for the next stage** in the background. By the time the human is ready to review the next stage, all processing is already complete.

**Key Benefit**: Humans never wait for processing - they only review what's already been prepared.

---

## üîÑ Complete Stage Flow with Pre-Processing

### **STAGE 0 ‚Üí STAGE 1**
**Trigger**: Human clicks "Start Ingestion"

**Processing** (Automated):
- Process PSD headlessly (extract layers, detect fonts)
- Process AEPX headlessly (parse structure, detect placeholders)
- Auto-match layers using name similarity
- Detect warnings (missing fonts, missing footage, unmatched placeholders)

**Status Change**: `pending` ‚Üí `processing` ‚Üí `awaiting_review` (Stage 2)

**Pre-Processing for Stage 2** (Background Thread):
1. Generate high-quality preview renders of all PSD layers
2. Generate preview renders of all AEPX layers
3. Create side-by-side comparison thumbnails
4. Calculate similarity scores for better matching
5. Prepare matching UI with all assets ready

**Result**: When human opens Stage 2, everything is already rendered

---

### **STAGE 2 ‚Üí STAGE 3**
**Trigger**: Human clicks "Approve Matching"

**Processing** (Human):
- Review auto-matched layers
- Adjust incorrect matches
- Resolve warnings if possible

**Status Change**: `awaiting_review` ‚Üí `awaiting_approval` (Stage 3)

**Pre-Processing for Stage 3** (Background Thread):
1. Generate ExtendScript with approved layer mappings
2. Render side-by-side preview video (PSD flat vs AE render)
3. Create preview thumbnails
4. Calculate render metrics (time, quality)
5. Prepare approval UI with preview ready to play

**Result**: When human opens Stage 3, preview video is already rendered and ready to watch

---

### **STAGE 3 ‚Üí STAGE 4**
**Trigger**: Human clicks "Approve for Deployment"

**Processing** (Human):
- Watch side-by-side preview
- Can approve WITH warnings (logged)
- Final approval decision

**Status Change**: `awaiting_approval` ‚Üí `ready_for_validation` (Stage 4)

**Pre-Processing for Stage 4** (Background Thread):
1. Generate final AEP with unique output name
2. Run Plainly validator on final AEP
3. Check for validation errors
4. Prepare validation report
5. If no errors: Mark as ready for deployment
6. If errors: Mark as needs sign-off

**Result**: Validation already complete when human checks status

---

### **STAGE 4 COMPLETION**
**Two Paths**:

**Path A: Validation Passed** (Automated):
- Auto-deploy to output directory
- Status: `completed`
- Human sees: "Download" button

**Path B: Validation Failed** (Needs Human):
- Human reviews validation errors
- Human decides: Fix and re-process OR Force approve
- Status: `validation_failed` ‚Üí manual approval ‚Üí `completed`

---

3. `_preprocess_stage2(job_id)` - Prepare matching UI
4. `_preprocess_stage3(job_id)` - Prepare preview approval
5. `_preprocess_stage4(job_id)` - Validate and deploy

**Dependencies**:
- JobService (already implemented ‚úÖ)
- LogService (already implemented ‚úÖ)
- WarningService (already implemented ‚úÖ)

   - For text layers, render text as image
   - Store in `data/stage2_prep/<job_id>/psd_previews/`

2. **Generate AEPX Layer Previews**
   - Use aerender to export single frame of each layer
   - Store in `data/stage2_prep/<job_id>/aepx_previews/`

3. **Create Side-by-Side Comparison Thumbnails**
   - For each potential match pair, create comparison image
   - Store in `data/stage2_prep/<job_id>/comparisons/`

4. **Calculate Similarity Scores**
   - Image similarity (using PIL/OpenCV)
   - Name similarity (Levenshtein distance)
   - Create similarity matrix for UI

5. **Prepare Matching UI Data Structure**
   ```python
   matching_data = {
       'psd_previews': {layer_name: preview_path},
       'aepx_previews': {layer_name: preview_path},
       'comparisons': {pair_id: comparison_path},
       'similarity_scores': [[score_matrix]],
       'auto_matches': [...]  # From Stage 1
   }
   ```

       'ae_duration': seconds,
       'file_sizes': {
           'psd': bytes,
           'ae': bytes,
           'combined': bytes
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Prepare Approval UI Data**
   ```python
   approval_data = {
       'preview_video': path,
       'thumbnail': path,
       'psd_video': path,

```python
from services.stage_transition_manager import StageTransitionManager

# Initialize
transition_manager = StageTransitionManager(...)

# Stage 1 completion
@app.route('/api/stage1-complete/<job_id>', methods=['POST'])
def stage1_complete(job_id):
    transition_manager.transition_stage(job_id, 1, 2, 'system')
    return jsonify({'success': True})

# Stage 2 approval
@app.route('/approve-matching/<job_id>', methods=['POST'])
def approve_matching(job_id):
    data = request.json
    job_service.store_approved_matches(job_id, data['matches'])
    transition_manager.transition_stage(job_id, 2, 3, current_user.id)
    return jsonify({'success': True})

# Stage 3 approval
@app.route('/approve-final/<job_id>', methods=['POST'])

- Update database from background threads (thread-safe)

### **Progress Tracking**:
- Log start/end of each pre-processing step
- Store progress in job metadata
- Dashboard can poll for progress updates

### **Resource Management**:
- Limit concurrent background threads (e.g., max 5 at once)
- Clean up temp files after successful deployment
- Monitor disk space for preview videos
