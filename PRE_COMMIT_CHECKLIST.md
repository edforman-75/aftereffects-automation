## Final Pre-Commit Tests

### 1. Dry Run - See What Will Be Committed

```bash
# Initialize git if not already done
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Check status (review what will be committed)
git status

# See diff of staged files
git diff --cached --stat

# Count files to be committed
git diff --cached --name-only | wc -l
```

### 2. Verify No Sensitive Data

```bash
# Search for common sensitive patterns
git diff --cached | grep -i "password\|secret\|api_key\|token" || echo "No sensitive data found"

# Check for email addresses (should only be in LICENSE/docs)
git diff --cached | grep -oE '\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b'
```

### 3. Verify .gitignore Works

```bash
# These should all return "ignored" status
git check-ignore venv/ || echo "WARNING: venv/ not ignored"
git check-ignore __pycache__ || echo "WARNING: __pycache__ not ignored"
git check-ignore .env || echo "WARNING: .env not ignored"
git check-ignore logs/app.log || echo "WARNING: logs/*.log not ignored"
git check-ignore data/projects/test.json || echo "WARNING: data/projects/* not ignored"
```

### 4. Verify .gitkeep Files Included

```bash
# These should all return "not ignored" (will be committed)
git check-ignore data/projects/.gitkeep && echo "ERROR: .gitkeep is ignored" || echo "OK: .gitkeep will be committed"
```
