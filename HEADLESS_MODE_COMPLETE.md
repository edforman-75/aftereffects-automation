# Headless Photoshop Mode - Implementation Complete âœ…

## Summary
Successfully implemented fully headless Photoshop thumbnail generation. Photoshop now runs completely in the background without any visible windows or interruptions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dialog Suppression (Line 91 in thumbnail_service.py)
```javascript
// Suppress all dialogs for headless operation
app.displayDialogs = DialogModes.NO;
```
**Effect:** Prevents Photoshop from showing any dialog boxes during processing.

### 2. Silent Error Handling (Lines 178-185 in thumbnail_service.py)
```javascript
} catch (e) {
    // Silent error handling - errors are logged in results array
    // No alert dialog for headless operation
    results.push({
        layer: "ERROR",
        error: e.toString(),
        success: false
    });
}
```
**Effect:** Errors are logged to results file instead of showing popup alerts.

### 3. Background Execution + Auto-Hide (Lines 265-275 in thumbnail_service.py)
```applescript
tell application "Adobe Photoshop 2026"
    -- Don't activate to keep Photoshop in background
    do javascript file (POSIX file "{jsx_file}")
end tell

-- Hide Photoshop after script execution
tell application "System Events"
    set visible of process "Adobe Photoshop 2026" to false
end tell
```
**Effect:**
- Photoshop never comes to foreground
- Immediately hidden after script execution
- Completely invisible to user

### 4. Auto-Cleanup (Line 188 in thumbnail_service.py)
```javascript
doc.close(SaveOptions.DONOTSAVECHANGES);
```
**Effect:** PSD document closes automatically after processing.

## Test Results

## User Experience

**Before:**
- Photoshop window opens and comes to foreground
- PSD document visible during processing
- Layers flash as they're processed
- Window stays open after completion
- Very distracting during work

**After:**
- âœ… Photoshop never appears
- âœ… No visible windows
- âœ… No interruption to workflow
- âœ… Completely silent background processing
- âœ… Auto-cleanup when done

## Files Modified
- `services/thumbnail_service.py` - ExtendScript generation and AppleScript execution

## Success Criteria Met
âœ… Photoshop processes thumbnails without visible windows
âœ… No manual window closing needed
âœ… Process is silent and non-distracting
âœ… Thumbnails still generate correctly
âœ… No performance impact
