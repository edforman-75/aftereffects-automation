## Tips

### Keep Terminal Closed
- You never need Terminal after setup
- The app handles everything

### Leave Menu Bar Icon Running
- Keep the ðŸŽ¬ icon running in background
- Start/stop server as needed
- Only quit when completely done

### Check Status at a Glance
- Look at menu bar: ðŸŸ¢ = ready, ðŸ”´ = stopped
- No need to open browser to check

### Quick Restart
- If something goes wrong: Click ðŸŽ¬ â†’ Stop Server â†’ Start Server
- This resets everything

## What Gets Installed?

The setup script creates:
- **Virtual environment** (isolated Python packages)
- **Dependencies** (Flask, PSD tools, etc.)
- **Data directories** (for your projects)
- **The Mac app** (AE Automation.app)

Everything stays in the project folder - nothing installed system-wide except Python (which you need anyway).

---

## Uninstalling

If you ever want to remove the tool:

1. Quit the app (ðŸŽ¬ â†’ Quit)
2. Delete the entire project folder
3. Done!

No system files are modified, so it's completely clean.
