# Drag-and-Drop Fixes - Complete

**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and Enhanced

---

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Drag-and-Drop Limited Functionality
**Problem:** Could only drop on AE name column (column 5), not on AE preview column (column 6)

**Solution:** Made BOTH AE columns accept drops

**Changes:**
- `/static/js/stage2_review.js:78-136` - Enhanced setupDragAndDrop()
  - Both AE name AND preview columns are now drop targets
  - Added row highlighting when dragging over
  - Added toast notification on successful swap
  - Improved logging for debugging

### Issue 2: Lack of Visual Feedback
**Problem:** Not obvious what's draggable or where you can drop

**Solution:** Added comprehensive visual feedback

**Changes:**
- `/static/css/stage2_review.css:748-809` - New drag-and-drop styles
  - ⋮⋮ drag handle indicator on draggable cells
  - Pulsing blue dashed border on drop targets
  - Row opacity change when dragging
  - Grab/grabbing cursor states
  - Background color change on drop zones

---

## New Features

### Visual Indicators

1. **Drag Handle** (`⋮⋮`)
   - Appears on left side of PSD layer names
   - Shows which cells are draggable
   - Becomes darker on hover

2. **Grab Cursor**
   - Changes to grab hand (✋) on hover
   - Changes to grabbing (✊) when dragging

3. **Dragging State**
   - Row becomes semi-transparent (40% opacity)
   - Slightly scales down (98%)
   - Gray background

4. **Drop Target Highlighting**
   - Blue dashed border (pulsing animation)
   - Light blue background
   - Entire row gets highlighted
   - Blue glow shadow effect

5. **Success Feedback**
   - Toast notification: "Matches swapped"
   - Immediate table re-render
   - Drag-and-drop re-initialized

### Console Logging

Enhanced debugging output:
```javascript
setupDragAndDrop() called
Found 6 table rows
Made PSD cell draggable for row 0
Made AE cell name a drop target for row 0
Made AE cell preview a drop target for row 0
...
✅ Drag-and-drop setup complete
Drag started from row 0
Drop: Moving row 0 to row 2
Swapped AE matches between rows 0 and 2
```

## How It Works

### Drag Flow

```
User hovers over PSD layer name
  ↓
  Cursor changes to grab (✋)
  ↓
User clicks and drags
  ↓
  Cursor changes to grabbing (✊)
  Row becomes semi-transparent
  ⋮⋮ handle visible
  ↓
User drags over another row
  ↓
  AE cells get blue dashed border
  Row background becomes light blue
  Border pulses with animation
  ↓
User releases mouse (drops)
  ↓
  Matches swap positions
  Table re-renders
  Toast: "Matches swapped"
  Drag-and-drop re-initialized
```

### Technical Details

**Draggable Cells:**
- Column 2 (PSD layer name)

**Drop Target Cells:**
- Column 5 (AE layer name) ✅
- Column 6 (AE preview icon) ✅ NEW

**Data Transfer:**
- Uses `dataTransfer` API
- Stores row index as plain text
- Effect allowed: 'move'
- Drop effect: 'move'

**Critical Lines:**
```javascript
// Line 87: MUST call preventDefault() in dragover
e.preventDefault();  // Without this, drop won't work

// Line 103: MUST call preventDefault() in drop
e.preventDefault();  // Without this, drop won't work
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Drag-and-Drop

1. Open http://localhost:5001/review-matching/FINAL_TEST
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+R` to hard refresh
3. Hover over "BEN FORMAN" in PSD column
   - ✅ Should see grab cursor (✋)
   - ✅ Should see ⋮⋮ handle on left
4. Click and drag "BEN FORMAN"
   - ✅ Row becomes semi-transparent
   - ✅ Cursor changes to grabbing (✊)
5. Drag over row 3 (ELOISE GRACE)

   - ✅ AE preview cell gets blue dashed border
   - ✅ Border pulses with animation
   - ✅ Row background becomes light blue
6. Release mouse
   - ✅ Toast: "Matches swapped"
   - ✅ Table updates
   - ✅ Row 1 now shows: BEN FORMAN → ELOISE GRACE
   - ✅ Row 3 now shows: ELOISE GRACE → BEN FORMAN

### Test 2: Drop on Preview Column

1. Drag any PSD layer
2. Drop on the AE **preview icon column** (column 6)
   - ✅ Should work (previously didn't)
   - ✅ Matches swap
   - ✅ Toast notification appears

### Test 3: Drop on Same Row

1. Drag a PSD layer
2. Drop on its own row
   - ✅ Nothing happens (no swap)
   - ✅ No toast notification
   - ✅ Table doesn't re-render

### Test 4: Multiple Swaps

1. Swap row 1 with row 3
2. Immediately swap row 2 with row 4
3. Swap row 1 with row 2
   - ✅ All swaps work
   - ✅ Drag-and-drop re-initialized after each swap
   - ✅ Can continue dragging indefinitely

## CSS Classes Applied

### JavaScript-Applied Classes

**`.dragging`** - Applied to row being dragged
```css
tr.dragging {
    opacity: 0.4;
    background-color: #f3f4f6;
    transform: scale(0.98);
}
```

**`.drop-target`** - Applied to cell being hovered over
```css
td.drop-target {
    background-color: #dbeafe !important;
    border: 2px dashed #3b82f6 !important;

    box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.3);
}
```

**`.drop-target-row`** - Applied to entire row during drag-over
```css
tr.drop-target-row {
    background-color: #eff6ff;

```

### HTML Attributes

**`draggable="true"`** - Applied to PSD name cells
```css
td[draggable="true"] {
    cursor: grab;
    position: relative;
}

td[draggable="true"]:active {

## Performance Considerations

### Event Listener Management

**Before Each Render:**
- Old event listeners are removed (elements destroyed)
- Table innerHTML cleared

**After Each Render:**
- `setTimeout(() => setupDragAndDrop(), 100)`
- Fresh event listeners attached
- No memory leaks

### Animation Performance

**CSS Animations Used:**
- `dropPulse` - 1s infinite loop
- GPU-accelerated (transform, opacity)
- Pauses when not dragging

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2
1. **Keyboard Support**
   - Arrow keys to move matches
   - Enter to select
   - Escape to cancel

2. **Touch Support**
   - Mobile drag-and-drop
   - Long-press to activate

3. **Multi-Select**
   - Shift+click to select range
   - Ctrl+click to multi-select
   - Drag multiple rows at once

4. **Undo/Redo**
   - Ctrl+Z to undo swap
   - Ctrl+Y to redo
   - History stack

5. **Visual Improvements**
   - Ghost image while dragging
   - Insertion indicator line
   - Smooth animations

## Troubleshooting

### Drag Doesn't Start
- **Check:** Is cursor changing to grab?
- **Solution:** Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)

### Drop Doesn't Work
- **Check:** Is blue border appearing?
- **Solution:** Check console for errors
- **Common Cause:** `preventDefault()` not called

### Can't Drop on Preview Column
- **Check:** Is column 6 getting `drop-target` class?
- **Solution:** Verify both cells are in `aeCells` array

### Drag Handle Not Visible
- **Check:** Is `::before` pseudo-element working?
- **Solution:** Verify `position: relative` on draggable cell

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Can grab PSD layer name (cursor changes)
✅ Can drag PSD layer (row becomes semi-transparent)
✅ Can drop on AE name column
✅ Can drop on AE preview column (NEW)
✅ Blue dashed border appears on drop target
✅ Entire row highlights on drag-over
✅ Matches swap on drop
✅ Toast notification appears
✅ Table re-renders correctly
✅ Can drag again immediately
✅ Console logging confirms all actions

---

## Conclusion

Drag-and-drop functionality is now fully operational with comprehensive visual feedback. Users can intuitively swap matches by dragging PSD layers onto either AE column (name or preview icon).
