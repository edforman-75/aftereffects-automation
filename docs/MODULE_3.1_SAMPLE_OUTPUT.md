# Module 3.1: Content Matcher Sample Output

## Test Files
- **PSD**: test-photoshop-doc.psd (1200x1500, 6 layers)
- **AEPX**: test-after-effects-project.aepx (1920x1080, 6 placeholders)

## Mappings Created

### High-Confidence Text Mappings (100%)
1. **BEN FORMAN** → player1fullname
   - Sequential match: 1st text layer to 1st text placeholder
   
2. **ELOISE GRACE** → player2fullname
   - Sequential match: 2nd text layer to 2nd text placeholder
   
3. **EMMA LOUISE** → player3fullname
   - Sequential match: 3rd text layer to 3rd text placeholder

### Medium-Confidence Image Mapping (60%)
4. **cutout** → featuredimage1
   - Name similarity match + smartobject type

## Unmapped Content
- **green_yellow_bg** (smart object) - Background element, not a placeholder
- **Background** (image layer) - Background element, not a placeholder

*These are correctly unmapped as they're decorative, not content placeholders*

## Unfilled Placeholders
- **playername** (text) - From "Player Card" secondary composition
- **playerphoto** (image) - From "Player Card" secondary composition

*These belong to a different composition not targeted by this PSD*

## Success Metrics
- ✅ 4/4 main composition placeholders filled (100%)
- ✅ 3/3 high-confidence matches (100%)
- ✅ 0 false positives (correctly ignored background layers)
- ✅ 0 false negatives (all content mapped)

## Next Phase
Ready for Module 4.1: ExtendScript Generator
This will generate the After Effects script to actually populate the template.
